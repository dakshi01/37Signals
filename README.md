# 37Signals
An app to keep the 37Signals lil handy for myself. 

37Signals has made amazing products - Basecamp and Hey. I think of 37Signals not just as a successful company, but as a philosophy too.
The folks at 37Signals built this amazing website - https://37signals.com/ . 

However, I wanted to keep them more handy and SwiftUI just made it easy and fun. 

The code for the app is open source. But the Signals are Jason Fried's and DHH's, the founders of 37Signals. (Full disclosure).
